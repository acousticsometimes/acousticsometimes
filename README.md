# Livy Pang
### Full-Stack Developer | Cybersecurity Graduate | Designer

UOW Double Major: Cybersecurity & Digital Systems Security

I build secure, high-performance web applications from the ground up. Based in Indonesia, I specialize in the intersection of creative design and robust engineering—ensuring that every digital experience I create is as visually engaging as it is architecturally sound.

🛠️ **Tech Stack**
- Advanced: `React` `Canva` `HTML5` `CSS3`
- Intermediate: `Figma` `PHP` `Tailwind CSS` `JavaScript` `Firebase` `MySQL`

🔭 **Featured Projects**
- [Therma-Snaps Photobooth](https://therma-snaps-photobooth.vercel.app/) - A creative web app that blends modern browser tech with retro aesthetics. I developed a custom dithering algorithm to transform high-res captures into stylized, 1-bit monochrome images—giving them a unique receipt-print look. Built with WebRTC, the project focuses on a "one-tap" user journey, making technical complexity feel effortless through clean, intentional UI/UX design.
- [Krema POS](https://cremapos-e14a5.web.app/) - A high-performance POS engineered for fast-paced hospitality environments. I built a robust inventory engine that tracks ingredients at the recipe level, paired with a minimalist, dark-mode UI designed for maximum speed. Using React, Firebase, and Tailwind CSS, I delivered a seamless, cloud-synced experience that balances complex backend logic with an intuitive user interface.
